            By purchasing and enrolling in this course, you agree to our Terms and Conditions and acknowledge that all course content is provided for educational purposes only. Class start dates may vary or be delayed due to the scheduling and completion of existing student batches. We operate on a structured intake system to ensure quality delivery, and as such, we do not offer refunds for delayed starts. Please enroll only if you understand and accept this scheduling policy.

          <p className="mt-3">
            Results are entirely dependent on your commitment, consistency, and individual effort. While many of our students have achieved outstanding results, we make no guarantees of specific outcomes. By enrolling, you accept full responsibility for your progress and understand that lack of results does not qualify for a refund. This course is a self-responsibility-based learning program, and your success ultimately depends on your actions.
